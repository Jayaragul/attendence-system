Face Detection System using OpenCV
This project demonstrates a basic face detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The system reads an image, detects faces, and highlights them by drawing rectangles around them.

Features
Face Detection: Detects multiple faces in an image using Haar Cascade Classifier.
Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Customization: Parameters for detection can be adjusted for accuracy.
